Sonic Pinwheel is a shared musical installation of web-based pinwheel instruments running on mobile/desktop devices. Bring in your phone as a musical instrument, blow into the microphone and watch as pinwheels spin together in melodious harmony. Create ambient music together and bathe in a sound space of sonic pinwheels, soothing winds, and sparkly chimes. A distributed, shared, and collaborative musical experience.
